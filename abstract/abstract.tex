The present project implemented an alternative to improve the availability of data on a medium-large enterprise, centralizing the servers through the implementation of a VPN by means of radio frequencies and backup link via Internet.\\
The advantages of this implementation were immediate, be it with the reduction of the costs in infrastructure, reduction of the administrative expenses and increase in the service resilience among others things.\\
A connection via VPN allowed the centralization and better management of the data without many complications for either its maintenance or the need to buy expensive or complex equipment (physical traditional servers.\\
Centralizing the servers helped in managing the servers themselves, reduced the costs and facilitates the data management; in addition, with the reduction of the quantity of servers the backup takes less time.\\
To implement this infrastructure it was made use of the RouterOS operating system based on GNU/Linux for its high reliability and its easy management through a graphical interface, as well as access via Telnet, SSH and Web, considering the aforementioned, the router Mikrotik is represented in the market as a strong solution, professionally and economically feasible in comparison to routers from other manufacturers with similar services.
